 No master key was found. The server will accept unidentified requests.

 A master key of at least 16 bytes will be required when switching to a production environment.


We generated a new secure master key for you (you can safely use this token):

>> --master-key ampL3RuYk50ghQIOZ43_Gef4zikqz5eJNSyAJ1PNeJs <<

Restart Meilisearch with the argument above to use this new and secure master key.
